# Cash Backie Capstone Project
by Jonathan Cheon

### What
Cash Backie is an iOS app that recommends the best credit cards to use to maximize cash back based on your location. 

### Why
This app came from my interest in personal finance and credit cards. One of the best things about credit cards is getting the rewards. Since each credit cards are unique in their's benefits, it becomes incredibaly difficult to use the best card. At each of my purchases, I always have to make a difficult choice of choosing the card with the maximum cash back. I was tired of this and decided to make it my capstone project. Next time I'm at a store, I could just pull up my app and it can tell me which card to use. 

I hope this app could help others that have lots of credit cards or want to maximize their cash back. Cash Backie makes choosing the card easier :)
